### Trading Strategy Recommendations
Given the data:
- The stock may be considered for strategic **BUY** opportunities if the price rebounds from the lower Bollinger Band or shows signs of crossing above the middle band in conjunction with a bullish momentum signal from MACD.
- A **HOLD** strategy may also be valid during the neutral RSI phase, especially as the stock hovers around key moving average indicators.
- However, if the price breaks below $97.87 with increasing volume, traders should consider shifting from **HOLD** to a **SELL** position to minimize losses.

### FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
