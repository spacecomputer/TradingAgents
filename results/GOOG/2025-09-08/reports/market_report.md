Here is a detailed technical analysis of Google's (GOOG) stock based on selected indicators over the past month leading up to September 8, 2025. This analysis uses moving averages (short and long-term), momentum indicators, MACD and RSI, and volatility gauges, particularly Bollinger Bands. These indicators help determine trends, potential reversals, and market conditions.

### Moving Averages
- **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** The current value as of September 5 is approximately 195.83. The gradual increase in the 50 SMA shows a medium-term upward trend, indicating the stock is currently in a healthy positive trend. This average serves as a support level when the price trends upward.
  
- **200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** The current value is around 180.63 as of September 5. This long-term trend indicator is lower than the 50 SMA, reinforcing the broader upward trend. The gap between the 50 and 200 SMA suggests sustained bullish market conditions over time.

- **10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** On September 5, the 10 EMA is at 219.66, pointing to sharp short-term momentum in the stock price, confirming the general increase seen in recent weeks.

### MACD Analysis
- **MACD Line:** The MACD reading rose sharply to 9.19 by September 5, indicating strong bullish momentum as the EMA differences have widened significantly in recent days.
  
- **MACD Signal Line:** At 6.69, it shows the crossover that occurred earlier, validating the sustained upward movement in the stock price.

- **MACD Histogram:** The positive values (2.50 on September 5) illustrate the strength and widening of bullish momentum as evidenced by the gap between MACD and its signal line.

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- **RSI Value:** By September 5, the RSI hit 84.54, well into overbought territory. This suggests the potential for a correction or consolidation, as the asset may be experiencing overheated buying conditions without a substantial pullback.

### Volatility Indicator
- **Bollinger Middle Band (20-day SMA):** As of the last reading, it stands at 209.80. The price is consistently breaching past this median band, implying the presence of heightened volatility and the potential challenge to sustain recent highs without pullbacks.

### Analysis Summary
Google's stock has been exhibiting strong upward momentum across nearly all indicators. The 10 EMA has made swift advances, reflecting rapid short-term price movements. Meanwhile, the 50 and 200 SMAs confirm sustained upward momentum within the medium- and long-term horizons. The RSI highlights a potential overheating of the stock, suggesting caution for new entries until a retracement or stabilization appears. Lastly, MACD values and Bollinger Bands support a fast-paced, volatile environment that may lead to periods of pullback or consolidation.
